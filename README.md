# Movie & TV Series Library

## Goal For This Project
We want to create a library that lets the user search for different movies and TV shows. After looking up a specific keyword or genre a list of movies/ TV shows suiting the filter is displayed. When selecting one of the items all information is being displayed. The user then has the option to add given movie or show to a watchlist which stores the information in local storage.

## User Story
